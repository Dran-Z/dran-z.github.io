  abstract = {The generation of multiple entangled qubit pairs between distributed nodes is a prerequisite for a future quantum Internet. To achieve a practicable generation rate, standard protocols based on photonic qubits require multiple long-term quantum memories, which remains a significant experimental challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol based on 2m-dimensional time-bin photonic qudits that allows for the simultaneous generation of multiple (m) entangled pairs between two distributed qubit registers and we outline a specific implementation of the protocol based on cavity-mediated spin-photon interactions. By adopting the qudit protocol, the required qubit memory time is independent of the transmission loss between the nodes, in contrast to standard qubit approaches. As such, our protocol can significantly boost the performance of near-term quantum networks.},

  abstract = {Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantum advantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizer codes with transversal \$T\$ gates, there exists quite several protocols that don't fall into this class. We propose a method to map MSD protocols to iterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. With our mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols using techniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillation process of input states under arbitrary noise model and visualize it using flow diagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for \${\textbackslash}ket\{T\}\$ state and find some interesting properties: The \$[[15, 1, 3]]\$ code may distill states corresponding to \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}\$ gate and the \$[[5, 1, 3]]\$ code can distill the magic state for corresponding to the \$T\$ gate. Besides, we examine the exotic MSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. We also study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes and numerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols with various magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, we can reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposed method will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols for canonical MSD protocols on \${\textbackslash}ket\{T\}\$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocols for other states.},

  abstract = {We examine the impact of imperfect measurement on magic state distillation (MSD) process by employing the framework of stabilizer reduction, which characterizes MSD protocols using stabilizer codes. We show the existence of thresholds for measurement strength in MSD protocols, below which there doesn't exist non-trivial target states and no input states can be distilled into better states. We prove that for MSD protocols based on CSS codes with transversal non-Clifford gates, the first-order effect of imperfect measurement will at most cause biased Pauli noise on the target states. Furthermore, we prove that we can minimize the effect of imperfect measurement noise on the asymptotically distilled states by measuring stabilizer generators in the standard form. We numerically demonstrate our theoretical results by simulating the \$[[15, 1, 3]]\$ and \$[[14, 2, 2]]\$ MSD protocols using the mapping from MSD protocols to dynamical systems. Our numerical results imply that the existence of imperfect measurement degrades the order of convergence rate to linear, regardless of the original order in the noiseless case. Our work will therefore contribute to understanding fault-tolerant quantum computing under imperfect measurement noise.},
