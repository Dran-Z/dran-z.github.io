I am currently a graduate student at Yale Applied Physics with with [Alex Kubica](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/aleksander-kubica). I am interested in general quantum fault tolerance, with a focus on magic state distillation, color codes as well as graph states. I am always happy for related academic discussion. I am also weekly active on [QC StackExchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/users/23123/yunzhe).


Before my study at Yale, I finished my master study at TU Delft and undergraduate study at Tsinghua University.
